# CheatSheet for GraphQL

>GraphQL is API just like Restful API
1. It is fast because it has only one end point, so less request for quering data.
2. It is Flexible because we can decide to query data at clients not at server(diff for mobile and laptops), so we can query any type of data as a query.Giving clients the full control to ask for data they need.
3. Easy to use at simple to maintain.

> Graph is all the data and relationship between them. (eg. USER, POST COMMENT)

> GraphQl querying is just like the postman extension in chrome.

> There are three types of request
1. Querying 
2. Mutation
3. Subscription

## Quering Data

> query return data in JSON format as a data property in the object
> By default all appl. are self documenting. API exposes a schema that describes exactly what operations could be performed on the API.
> type as String! represents it doesn't return null.

> NOTE: We have to specify all the fields we want, nothing more and less.

1. Querying simple types
2. Objects
3. Array of Objects
